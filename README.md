# Coding Katas

This project is going to be used to solve different programming questions. These problems are picked from different
resources such as [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com), [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com), etc.

Solving these questions will help with mastering some details of the programming language (Java in this case), data
structures and algorithms.

As I add to this project, I will be aiming at organizing it in a way that is easy to find problems by category and learn more
about each topic. I also try to include some useful information such as time and space complexity.
